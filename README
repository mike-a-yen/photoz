The goal is to use EAZY, BPZ, and other photoz template fitters (gave up on ZPEG) to yield P(z) plots

In order to do this, I need to first take hst images from various filters, apply aperature photometry to the objects detected by sep (Kyle Barbary), and write the AB magnitudes for each filter to a catalog. The catalog needs to include the object ID number (arbitrary), magnitude, and magnitude error in each filter. I have also included the x,y and RA,DEC.

#1. Make Catalog from HST images
    from shell, run see_change_db --data_path data/
    	 # this opens an ipython prompt
    import makeCat as MC
    Initialize the data for the cluster with
    	 cl = MC.ClusterData('<cluster name>')
    Write Catalog (saved as CATALOGS/<cluster name>.cat)
    	  cl.WriteCatalog()

#2. Make .column file for BPZ (saved as CATALOGS/<cluster name>.columns)
    cl.WriteColumns()

#3. Make a .param file for EAZY (saved as CATALOGS/<cluster name>.param)
    cl.ParamEAZY()
#4. Make a .translate file for EAZY (saved as CATALOGS/<cluster name>.translate)
    cl.TranslateEAZY()
#5. Make a .zeropoint file for EAZY (saved as CATALOGS/<cluster name>.zeropoint)
    cl.ZeroPointEAZY()

These steps prep all of the files needed to run BPZ and EAZY from the command prompt or from the methods in ClusterData, cl.RunBPZ() and cl.RunEAZY()

bpz CATALOGS/<cluster name>.cat -COLUMNS CATALOGS/<cluster name>.columns -OUTPUT BPZ/<cluster name>.bpz

eazy -p CATALOGS/<cluster name>.param -t CATALOGS/<cluster name>.translate -z CATALOGS/<cluster name>.zeropoint

BPZ and EAZY will yield files with the P(z) for each object, then I need to create P(z) plots from these files for each object

At some point I will need to combine the P(z) for BPZ and EAZY to get the 'best' P(z)
